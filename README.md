# File Cabinet

#### Made in Ruby on Rails
##### Ruby Practice

### Problem:
We often find our documents lying here and there and sometimes it becomes really annoying to find a right document on a right time.

### Solution:
This simple app will give you access to create a document and save it. You can use it whenever you want with simply login to your account.

Create a app File Cabinet

1. Create new rails project
        
   rails new cabinet

2. bundle install
3. cd into cabinet
4. rails server - this runs app in local machine, localhost://3000

commands for git

1. git status
2. git add —all
3. git commit -m ‘Initial commit’
4. git push -u origin master

Open your fav code editor
- for me its ATOM

  atom.

Commands:

1. rails generate controller welcome index
if we want to create a view, we have to  create a controller and define the action

welcome is a controller
index is an action

it will create these files for us
